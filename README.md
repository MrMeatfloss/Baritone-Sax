# Baritone-Sax

In my opinion, the baritone saxophone is not very beginner friendly beacuse it requires more air to play than something like a alto sax. The baritone saxophone is also very heavy, thus making it difficult to carry for a lot of people due to it's overwhelming size at over 1 m tall, as well as being 11-20 pounds heavy depending on the material manufacturers used.
