# Baritone-Sax

In my opinion, the baritone saxophone is not very beginner friendly beacuse it requires more air to play than something like a alto sax. The baritone saxophone is also very heavy, thus making it difficult to carry for a lot of people due to it's overwhelming size at over 1 m tall, as well as being 11-20 pounds heavy depending on the material manufacturers used.

The baritone saxophone is pitched at Eâ™­, which is the same as the alto saxophone but an octave lower. This means that the baritone saxophone makes the lowest/deepest sound of all the saxophones listed in this guide. One thing that I've realized throughout playing the saxophone is that lower notes will always be harder to play than higher notes. Even when I am playing my tenor saxophone as of today, I sometimes struggle to hit the low notes hence why I decided to stick with the tenor sax instead of the baritone sax. 

Playing the baritone sax also requires good posture due to how heavy the instrument is in order to play well. This can be challenging especially when players try to play while standing up for something like a marching band, or when they have a solo coming up and they want to stand out. With the baritone saxophone being so big and heavy, it's limitations may require a handfull of people to play while sitting instead of standing up thus making it hard for beginners to play and adapt.
